👋 Hi, I’m Sooraj K

Principal QA / Test Architect

Designing scalable test strategies, automation frameworks, and quality systems for complex applications.

🧭 What I Focus On

I work at the system and architecture level of quality, beyond individual test cases or tools. My focus is on enabling teams to ship reliable software at scale.
	•	Test architecture for large, distributed systems
	•	Automation strategy (API, integration, contract, and end-to-end)
	•	Quality governance and standards
	•	Testability, observability, and risk-based testing
	•	Sustainable frameworks over brittle scripts

🏗️ How I Think About Quality

Quality is not a phase or a team — it’s a capability built into the system.

I believe in:
	•	Shifting quality left through design and architecture
	•	Reducing feedback loops with fast, reliable automation
	•	Using the right test at the right layer (test pyramid, not test explosion)
	•	Measuring quality with meaningful signals, not vanity metrics

📂 What You’ll Find Here

This GitHub profile is intentionally curated, not noisy.

You’ll find:
	•	Reference automation frameworks (API-first, maintainable by design)
	•	Proof-of-concept repos for test architecture patterns
	•	Utilities and helpers that solve real testing problems
	•	Documentation-heavy repos explaining why, not just how

Each repository is written as if it were meant to be used by a team, not just demonstrated.

🛠️ Tech & Practices (Selective)

I avoid long tool lists, but you’ll commonly see work around:
	•	API & integration testing
	•	Automation framework design
	•	CI/CD quality gates
	•	Test data & environment strategy
	•	Python-based test solutions
